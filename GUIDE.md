A beginner's guide to Alohacam:

* If you haven't already, request a Beta invite [here](https://lanikailabs.com/alohacam).

* Once you receive your invite email, click the unique link to register and log into your account. You're now ready to add your first device!

* Next, make sure your Raspberry Pi is powered on and connected to the Internet. 

* The main Alohacam webpage should now be displaying the "Add New Device" modal. 

* Choose a name for your Alohacam (like "Moana") and click Next. 

* The modal will now display a ____*Code? Executable? Command? What should I call this guy?*___. Copy this, and run it on your Raspberry Pi. 

* Your Raspberry Pi will now download and run the Alohacam executable. This may take a minute, so be patient :)

*** ___ Do they also need to add in a unique ID//code to register the device?? __ 

* Once you've run the executable and registered the device (?? Is this described correctly??), click Next. 

* You should now be back at the main page, where you can see your Alohacam. 

* From this page, you can control your device's live video. Connect to the device, pause, play, full screen, and picture in picture modes are all available from here. 

* If you run into any issues or still have questions, reach out to us at aloha@lanikailabs.com!
