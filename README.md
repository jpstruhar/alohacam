AlohaCam Beta FAQs

# What is Alohacam?
Alohacam is a video streaming solution for embedded devices, powered by our WebRTC native library, AlohaRTC. 

# How do I sign up for the Beta?
Just click _here_, enter your email address, and we'll send you the executable. It's as easy as that! 

# How long will the Beta be available?
We do not have a set timeline for the length of the Beta, but we're thinking 8-10 weeks. Stay tuned for more information on that! 

# What happens after the Beta ends?
After the Alohacam Beta wraps, we will still offer peer-to-peer (non-TURN) one-way video streaming for free. Our plan is to use the findings from the Alohacam Beta software to polish the overall platform and launch with a full set of features. We look forward to showing you everything that AlohaRTC can do! 

# What development boards are currently supported?
The Alohacam Beta software currently supports Raspberry Pi 3B+ boards. We'll let you know as we release support for more development boards (looking at you, Jetson Nano!) â€“ so stay tuned. 

# How do I get started?
You'll need a Raspberry Pi 3B+ development kit, a real email address, and a sense of adventure! You can sign up for early access to the Beta _here_.
